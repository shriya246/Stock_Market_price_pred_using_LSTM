# 📈 Stock Market Price Prediction Using LSTM

This project showcases how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock market prices based on historical data.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This notebook demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing on stock price data
- Creating training sequences for time series prediction
- Designing and training an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualizing actual vs. predicted prices

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- NumPy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shriya246/Stock_Market_price_pred_using_LSTM.git
   cd Stock_Market_price_pred_using_LSTM

2. Install dependencies
     ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the notebook: Open Stock_Market_price_pred_using_LSTM.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run all cells.
   
📊 Results:
The LSTM model is trained to predict future stock closing prices based on past trends. Final visualizations show close alignment between predicted and actual prices.
